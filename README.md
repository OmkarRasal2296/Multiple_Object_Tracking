## Multiple-Object Tracking Example

### Overview
This MATLAB script exemplifies multi-object tracking within a video sequence. It aims to identify and monitor numerous moving objects in a video stream, assigning distinct identifiers (IDs) to each object and projecting their positions across frames utilizing the Kalman filter.

### Features
- Detects moving objects in video sequences.
- Tracks multiple objects across frames.
- Forecasts object locations in successive frames.
- Assigns unique IDs to each tracked object.
- Manages occlusions and temporary object disappearances.
- Provides real-time visualization of tracking results.

### System Requirements
- MATLAB (R2018a or later)
- Computer Vision Toolbox

### Installation
1. Download and install MATLAB from the MathWorks website (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
2. Ensure the installation of the Computer Vision Toolbox. If absent, install it using MATLAB Add-Ons.

### Usage
1. Launch MATLAB.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into the MATLAB editor.
3. Save the file with an appropriate name, e.g., `MultiObjectTrackingExample.m`.
4. Confirm your video file's presence in the MATLAB current directory or specify the correct path to the video file in the `VideoReader` object initialization.
5. Execute the script.
6. Two video players will appear, showcasing the original video and the detected objects with bounding boxes.

### Notes
- You might need to fine-tune parameters like the number of training frames, minimum blob area, and Kalman filter settings to match your specific video sequence and tracking needs.
- This example assumes compatibility of the video file with MATLAB's `VideoReader` object.
